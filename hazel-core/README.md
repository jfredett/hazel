`hazel` is a little chess engine in Rust from scratch by me. It's a work in progress,
and I doubt it'll ever be particularly good, but I rather like it and you're welcome to
read it and use it if you like.

This code is available under AGPLv3 for any commit in this repo up to the addition of the `LICENSE`
file, and under the terms of said license file after that.

## LOG

I keep a running log with what I'm working on in `LOG.md`, you may find it interesting to read. I
have only started doing that more recently (this is a recovered old project I worked on right after
my kid was born, I had to put it down for a while to focus on other things, and have recently
returned to it to get it into some kind of working shape).
