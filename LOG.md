Working on getting this fixed up and functional, I updated dependencies, cleaned up some syntax
stuff, got a `flake` set up and `rustfmt` configured and running. I'll add precommits at some point
maybe.

I'm working on the pgn parsing issue, it appears to be failing to generate blocking moves for check.
It gets stuck on 26. .. Rf7 in the example fixture at tests/fixtures/no-variations.pgn. The `perft`
test is also over-counting the number of moves, so I need to figure out why it isn't seeing the rook
move.

I'm going to check out [bugstalker](https://github.com/godzie44/BugStalker) to see if it helps suss
out what's happening.
