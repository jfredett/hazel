Hazel requires a CPU that supports the BMI1 and BMI2 instruction set for the `pextboard` feature, which allows fast
calculation of sliding piece movement using CPU intrinsics. You can disable this by disabling the `bmi1` or `bmi2`
features, but then Hazel won't work because I haven't written an alternative implementation. If you're reading this,
it's probably because the engine panicked and told you to read this. I'm sorry for the excitement, but probably your CPU
doesn't support those instruction sets, or you might need to tweak your build settings. You can use `lscpu` to see what
your CPU supports, a bit of grepping should tell you.
